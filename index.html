        <h1>Stage 1: The Excited Caleb</h1>
        <img src="img/excited.png">
        <p>Often found at the beginning of every briefing, the Excited Caleb is<br>
            known to have way too many ideas for his upcoming projects. While in this<br>
            stage the Caleb is often distracted and is known to lose focus in classes,<br>
            often forgetting to pay attention to anything that the professor is saying.</p>

        <h1>Stage 2: The Finicky Caleb</h1>
        <img src="img/finicky.png">
        <p>Known by many as “the OCD idiot that wastes too much time shifting pixels”,<br>
            the Finicky Caleb can be found glued to his MacBook fine-tuning unnecessary details.<br>
            At the end of most projects, 75% of the work done by the Finicky Caleb never sees the<br>
            light of day. No one, not even the Caleb himself, really knows why this stage happens, but<br>
            the Finicky Caleb continues to insist that this is an important step in the creative process.</p>

        <h1>Stage 3: The Procrastinating Caleb</h1>
        <img src="img/procrastination.png">
        <p>Having been lulled into a false sense of accomplishment by the Finicky Caleb,<br>
           the Procrastinating Caleb is hatched. The Procrastinating Caleb is known to have<br>
           terrible priorities and time management, and is often found binge-watching TV shows<br>
           and trash-talking people on the basketball court.</p>

        <h1>Stage 4: The Panicked Caleb</h1>
        <img src="img/panicked.png">
        <p>As the realization of imminent deadlines sets in, the Panicked Caleb arises from the ashes.<br>
           nown to sporadically drop F-bombs, the Panicked Caleb consumes at least two grande cups of<br>
           caffeine every day. During this stage, the Panicked Caleb somehow finds a way to become<br>
           nocturnal, often working through the night.</p>

        <h1>Stage 5: The Half-Awake Caleb</h1>
        <img src="img/halfawake.png">
        <p>Often sighted on presentation days, the Half-Awake Caleb appears after a long night of<br>
           project work. Though having not slept at all, the Half-Awake is often able to function at a<br>
           surprisingly efficient level. However, upon arriving home the Half-Awake becomes the<br>
           Not Awake Caleb in the span of five minutes.</p>
